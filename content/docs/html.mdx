# 🌐 Introduction 

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It tells the browser how to display text, images, links, and other elements on a webpage.

## ✅ Why Learn HTML?

- It’s the **foundation** of every website.
- Essential for **frontend development**.
- Required knowledge for most **web-related interviews**.

## 🧠 What HTML Does

HTML provides structure to web pages by using elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and links. Each element helps define the role and purpose of the content.

## 📚 Key Concepts

- **Elements & Tags**: Basic building blocks of HTML.
- **Attributes**: Add extra information to HTML elements.
- **Semantic HTML**: Using tags that describe their meaning (like `<header>` or `<footer>`).

## 🧱 Basic HTML Structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>


Explanation 
<!DOCTYPE html> defines the document type and version of HTML (HTML5 in this case).

<html> wraps the entire HTML document.

<head> contains metadata such as the title, styles, and scripts.

<body> holds all the visible content of the web page.
