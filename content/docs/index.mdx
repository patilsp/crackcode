# 🌐 Introduction to HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It tells the browser how to display text, images, links, and other elements on a webpage.

## ✅ Why Learn HTML?

- It’s the **foundation** of every website.
- Essential for **frontend development**.
- Required knowledge for most **web-related interviews**.

## 🧠 What HTML Does

HTML provides structure to web pages by using elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and links. Each element helps define the role and purpose of the content.

## 📚 Key Concepts

- **Elements & Tags**: Basic building blocks of HTML.
- **Attributes**: Add extra information to HTML elements.
- **Semantic HTML**: Using tags that describe their meaning (like `<header>` or `<footer>`).

## 🎯 In Interviews

Interviewers often ask:
- What is HTML and how does it work?
- What is the difference between HTML4 and HTML5?
- What are semantic elements and why are they important?

HTML is simple to learn but forms the **backbone** of all web development. Mastering its structure and purpose is the first step to becoming a great frontend developer.
