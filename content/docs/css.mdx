## Top 100 CSS Interview Questions and Answers

### 1. What is CSS ?
    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is primarily designed to separate web page content from its visual presentation.

### 2. What is the Box Model in CSS?
The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept that describes how elements are structured. Every element is treated as a box with:
- Content: The actual content area
- Padding: Clear space around the content
- Border: A border around the padding
- Margin: Clear space outside the border

### 3. What is CSS Specificity and how does it work?
CSS Specificity determines which CSS rule is applied by browsers when multiple rules target the same element. The hierarchy is:
- Inline styles (highest priority)
- IDs (#example)
- Classes (.example), attributes, and pseudo-classes
- Elements and pseudo-elements (lowest priority)

Example:
```css
#header .nav p { color: blue; }    /* Specificity: 0,1,1,1 */
.nav p { color: red; }            /* Specificity: 0,0,1,1 */
p { color: green; }               /* Specificity: 0,0,0,1 */
```

### 4. What is the difference between display: none and visibility: hidden?
- `display: none` - Removes the element from the document flow, taking up no space
- `visibility: hidden` - Hides the element but maintains its space in the layout

### 5. Explain CSS Box Sizing
`box-sizing` property defines how the width and height of an element are calculated:
- `content-box` (default): width/height only includes content
- `border-box`: width/height includes content, padding, and border

### 6. What is the difference between position: relative and position: absolute?
- `position: relative`: Positions element relative to its normal position
- `position: absolute`: Positions element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor

### 7. What are CSS Pseudo-classes?
Pseudo-classes are keywords that specify a special state of an element:
```css
a:hover { color: red; }      /* When mouse hovers */
input:focus { border: blue; } /* When input is focused */
li:first-child { }           /* First child element */
```

### 8. What is the difference between em and rem units?
- `em`: Relative to the font-size of the element
- `rem`: Relative to the font-size of the root element (html)

### 9. What is CSS Flexbox?
Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows or columns:
```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### 10. What is CSS Grid?
CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system for creating complex web layouts:
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 20px;
}
```

### 11. What are CSS Variables?
CSS Variables (Custom Properties) allow you to store and reuse values:
```css
:root {
  --primary-color: blue;
  --spacing: 20px;
}
.element {
  color: var(--primary-color);
  margin: var(--spacing);
}
```

### 12. What is the difference between margin and padding?
- `margin`: Space outside the element's border
- `padding`: Space between the element's content and border

### 13. What is the z-index property?
`z-index` controls the stacking order of positioned elements:
- Higher values appear on top
- Only works on positioned elements (relative, absolute, fixed)

### 14. What are CSS Media Queries?
Media queries allow you to apply different styles based on device characteristics:
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}
```

### 15. What is the difference between inline and block elements?
- `inline`: Takes only necessary width, doesn't start on new line
- `block`: Takes full width, starts on new line

### 16. What is the difference between transform and transition?
- `transform`: Changes the element's appearance (rotate, scale, etc.)
- `transition`: Animates the change between states

### 17. What is the difference between :before and :after pseudo-elements?
- `:before`: Inserts content before the element's content
- `:after`: Inserts content after the element's content

### 18. What is the difference between class and ID selectors?
- `.class`: Can be used multiple times
- `#id`: Must be unique in the document

### 19. What is the difference between display: flex and display: grid?
- `flex`: One-dimensional layout (row or column)
- `grid`: Two-dimensional layout (rows and columns)

### 20. What is the difference between position: fixed and position: sticky?
- `fixed`: Positioned relative to viewport, stays in place during scroll
- `sticky`: Toggles between relative and fixed based on scroll position

### 21. What is the difference between CSS animations and transitions?
- `transition`: Simple state changes (from one state to another)
- `animation`: Complex movements with multiple keyframes
```css
/* Transition example */
.button {
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

/* Animation example */
@keyframes bounce {
  0%, 100% { transform: translateY(0); }
  50% { transform: translateY(-20px); }
}
```

### 22. What is the difference between vh, vw, and % units?
- `vh`: Viewport height (1vh = 1% of viewport height)
- `vw`: Viewport width (1vw = 1% of viewport width)
- `%`: Percentage of parent element's size

### 23. What is the difference between CSS reset and normalize.css?
- `CSS Reset`: Removes all default browser styles
- `Normalize.css`: Preserves useful defaults while fixing browser inconsistencies

### 24. What is the difference between display: inline-block and display: inline?
- `inline`: Can't set width/height, margins only horizontal
- `inline-block`: Can set width/height, margins work in all directions

### 25. What is the difference between CSS Grid's fr unit and percentage?
- `fr`: Distributes available space proportionally
- `%`: Fixed percentage of container width
```css
.grid {
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr; /* Flexible distribution */
  /* vs */
  grid-template-columns: 25% 50% 25%; /* Fixed percentages */
}
```

```css
.modal {
  backdrop-filter: blur(5px);
  /* vs */
  filter: blur(5px);
}
```

### 31. Explain CSS Container Queries and their use cases
Container Queries allow styling elements based on their container's size rather than the viewport. This is particularly useful for reusable components.

```css
@container (min-width: 400px) {
  .card {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr;
  }
}

@container (max-width: 399px) {
  .card {
    display: block;
  }
}
```
Use cases:
- Reusable components that adapt to their container
- Complex layouts with nested responsive elements
- Design systems and component libraries

### 32. What is CSS Houdini and how does it extend CSS capabilities?
CSS Houdini is a set of APIs that allows developers to extend CSS by hooking into the browser's rendering engine.

Key APIs:
```javascript
// Paint API
registerPaint('my-gradient', class {
  paint(ctx, size) {
    const gradient = ctx.createLinearGradient(0, 0, size.width, size.height);
    gradient.addColorStop(0, 'blue');
    gradient.addColorStop(1, 'red');
    ctx.fillStyle = gradient;
    ctx.fillRect(0, 0, size.width, size.height);
  }
});

// Usage in CSS
.element {
  background-image: paint(my-gradient);
}
```

### 33. Explain CSS Scroll Snap and its implementation
Scroll Snap provides control over scroll behavior, creating a more app-like experience.

```css
.container {
  scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;
  overflow-x: scroll;
  display: flex;
}

.slide {
  scroll-snap-align: start;
  flex: 0 0 100%;
}
```
Key properties:
- `scroll-snap-type`: Defines scroll behavior
- `scroll-snap-align`: Defines snap points
- `scroll-snap-stop`: Controls whether scrolling can skip snap points

### 34. What are CSS Logical Properties and when should they be used?
Logical Properties provide writing-mode and direction-aware alternatives to physical properties.

```css
/* Physical properties */
.element {
  margin-top: 1rem;
  padding-left: 1rem;
  border-right: 1px solid black;
}

/* Logical properties */
.element {
  margin-block-start: 1rem;
  padding-inline-start: 1rem;
  border-inline-end: 1px solid black;
}
```
Benefits:
- Better support for RTL languages
- Easier maintenance for multilingual sites
- More semantic meaning

### 35. Explain CSS Subgrid and its implementation
Subgrid allows grid items to participate in their parent grid's layout.

```css
.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 1rem;
}

.grid-item {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: subgrid;
  /* Inherits parent's grid columns */
}
```
Use cases:
- Complex nested grid layouts
- Consistent alignment across grid levels
- Maintaining grid structure in nested components

### 36. What is CSS Cascade Layers and how does it help with specificity?
Cascade Layers provide a way to manage specificity and CSS organization.

```css
@layer base, components, utilities;

@layer base {
  .button { color: blue; }
}

@layer components {
  .button { color: red; }
}

@layer utilities {
  .button { color: green; }
}
```
Benefits:
- Better control over specificity
- Organized CSS architecture
- Easier maintenance of large codebases

### 37. Explain CSS View Transitions API
View Transitions API enables smooth transitions between different states of a page.

// JavaScript
document.startViewTransition(() => {
  // Update DOM
  updateContent();
});

// CSS
::view-transition-old(root),
::view-transition-new(root) {
  animation: fade 0.5s;
}
```
Use cases:
- Page transitions
- State changes
- Content updates

### 38. What is CSS Container Style Queries?

  to { transform: translateX(0); }
}

.element {
  animation: slide-in linear;
  animation-timeline: scroll();
  animation-range: entry 25% cover 50%;
}
```
Use cases:
- Parallax effects
- Scroll-triggered animations
- Progressive content reveal

### 40. What is CSS Anchor Positioning?
Anchor Positioning allows elements to be positioned relative to other elements.

```css
.tooltip {
  position: absolute;
  anchor: --target;
  top: anchor(bottom);
  left: anchor(center);
  translate: -50% 0;
}

.target {
  anchor-name: --target;
}
```
Benefits:
